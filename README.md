# Serenity (Work in Progress)

A user-friendly and customizable intranet of things framework that makes home automation a breeze. Automate your home with no code! 

Serenity is a web-based tool to automate Arduino based control systems without writing code. The user interface provides a way to easily monitor, control, and setup your system. 

Serenity is compatible with off the shelf Arduino sensors and is completely free and open source. It is made using the Johnny-Five (javascript robotics library) module and is compatible with (almost) all of its compatible hardware. 

The goal of this project is to create a tool that can easily automate any IoT device in your home and also allows you to create and manage your own smart devices/system.
